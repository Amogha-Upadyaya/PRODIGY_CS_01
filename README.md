# PRODIGY_CS_01
The following repository documents the Task-01 assigned during my Cybersecurity Internship at Prodigy InfoTech

## Description
Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher Algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

## Key Functionalities
- Encrypts text messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Decrypts encrypted messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Maintains non-alphabetic characters during encryption/decryption.
- Provides user input prompts for message and shift value.
- Validates user input for the shift value (integer only).
- Displays clear messages for successful encryption/decryption or invalid input.

## Technical Specifications
- Programming Language: Python
- Uses only built-in Python functionalities

## How to Use:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run main.py to execute the program.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose encryption or decryption.
4. Enter the message you want to encrypt/decrypt.
5. Enter the shift value (key) for the Caesar Cipher.
6. The program will display the encrypted/decrypted message.
